= User Case =

Bob wants to put a set of slides from SlideShare on his Google Sites. It's a pity that Google Sites supports most of Google's services and Google Gadgets, but no other 3-party content with `IFRAME` tag. Bob use the free-iframe gadget to solve this problem.

 # Bob insert this gadget on his Sites.
 # The browser shows a prompt to Bob for enter the content source URL, which originally comes from `SRC` attribute in `IFRAME` tag.
 # Bob paste the URL and select a proper size for the gadget, hit "OK."
 # After he click "Save" on his Site, the content from SlideShare correctly shows on the page.

= Requirement =

 * Embed content which user specified, correctly, with `IFRAME` or maybe `OBJECT`.
 * In the very first version, we DON'T supports other attributions but `SRC` in `IFRAME` tag.
