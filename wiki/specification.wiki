= User Case =

Bob wants to put a set of slides from SlideShare on his Google Sites. It's a pity that Google Sites supports most of Google's services and Google Gadgets, but no other 3-party content with <iframe> tag. Bob use the free-iframe gadget to solve this problem.

# Bob insert this gadget on his Sites.
# The browser shows a prompt to Bob for enter the content source URL, which originally comes from SRC attribute in <iframe> tag.
# Bob paste the URL and select a proper size for the gadget, hit "OK."
# After he click "Save" on his Site, the content from SlideShare correctly shows on the page.

= Requirement =

* Embed content which user specified, correctly, with <iframe> or maybe <object>
* In the very first version, we DON'T supports other attributions but SRC in <iframe> tag.
